<h1>Life in Weeks</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

I created a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

- You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
